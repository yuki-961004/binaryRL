\usage{
func_eta(value, utility, reward, occurrence, var1 = NA, var2 = NA, eta, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{The expected value of the stimulus in the subject's mind at this point in time.}

\item{utility}{The subjective value that the subject assigns to the objective reward.}

\item{reward}{The objective reward received by the subject after selecting a stimulus.}

\item{occurrence}{The number of times the same stimulus has appeared.}

\item{var1}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var1 = "Extra_Var1"`}

\item{var2}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var2 = "Extra_Var2"`}

\item{eta}{A parameter used in the `rate_func` (Learning Rate Function), 
representing the rate at which the subject updates the difference between the reward and the expected value in the subject's mind. 
In the TD model, there is a single learning rate throughout the experiment. 
In the RSTD model, two different learning rates are used when the reward is higher or lower than the expected value.
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `eta = c(0.3, 0.7)`}

\item{lambda}{An additional parameter that may be used in these functions. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}
}
\value{
learning rate eta

\note{
When customizing these functions, please ensure that you do not modify the arguments. 
Instead, only modify the `if-else` statements or the internal logic to adapt the function to your needs.
