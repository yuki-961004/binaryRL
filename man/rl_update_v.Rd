\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing only one stimulate. 
This data should include the following mandatory columns: 
"time_line", "L_choice", "R_choice", "choose", "reward". 
The following arguments allow you to customize the column names used for processing}

\item{initial_value}{A numeric value representing the subject's initial expected value for each stimulus's reward. 
If this value is not set, the subject will use the reward received after the first trial as the initial value for that stimulus. 
In other words, the learning rate for the first trial is 100%. 
Provide the initial value as a number 
default: `initial_value = NA`
e.g., `initial_value = 0`}

\item{gamma}{A parameter used in the `util_func` (Utility Function), often 
referred to as the discount rate. For example, in the utility equation 
`utility = gamma * reward`, if gamma < 1, it indicates that people discount 
the objective reward. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `gamma = c(0.7)`}

\item{eta}{A parameter used in the `rate_func` (Learning Rate Function), 
representing the rate at which the subject updates the difference between the reward and the expected value in the subject's mind. 
In the TD model, there is a single learning rate throughout the experiment. 
In the RSTD model, two different learning rates are used when the reward is higher or lower than the expected value.
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `eta = c(0.3, 0.7)`}

\item{lambda}{An additional parameter that may be used in these functions. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}

\item{util_func}{The function for the utility gamma, which you can customize}

\item{rate_func}{The function for the learning rate eta, which you can customize}

\item{time_line}{A vector specifying the name of the column that the sequence of the experiment. 
This argument defines how the experiment is structured, such as whether it is organized by "Block" with breaks in between, and multiple trials within each block. 
Provide the sequence as a character vector, 
e.g., `time_line = c("Block", "Trial")`}

\item{reward}{A string specifying the name of the column that represents the reward associated with the subject's choice. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `reward = "Reward"`}

\item{var1}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var1 = "Extra_Var1"`}

\item{var2}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var2 = "Extra_Var2"`}

\item{digits}{digits}
