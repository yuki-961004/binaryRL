\usage{
func_epsilon(i, var1 = NA, var2 = NA, threshold = 1, epsilon = NA, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{row number}

\item{var1}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var1 = "Extra_Var1"`}

\item{var2}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var2 = "Extra_Var2"`}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the number of initial trials during which the subject makes random choices 
rather than choosing based on the values of the options. This occurs because the subject has not yet learned the values of the options. 
For example, threshold = 20 means the subject will make completely random choices for the first 20 trials.
Provide the value as a number. 
default: `threshold = 1`}

\item{epsilon}{A parameter used in the `expl_func` (Exploration Function), 
determining whether the subject makes decisions based on the relative values of the left and right options, 
or chooses completely randomly. 
For example, when epsilon = 0.1, it means the subject has a 10% chance of making a completely random choice 
and a 90% chance of choosing based on the values of the options.
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `epsilon = c(0.1)`}

\item{lambda}{An additional parameter that may be used in these functions. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}
}
\value{

\note{
When customizing these functions, please ensure that you do not modify the arguments. 
Instead, only modify the `if-else` statements or the internal logic to adapt the function to your needs.
