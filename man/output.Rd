output(data, n_params, n_trials, gamma, eta, epsilon, tau, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{[data.frame] A data frame resulting from the 'step7' process of the `digits` function.}

\item{n_params}{[integer] The number of free parameters in your model.}

\item{n_trials}{[integer] The total number of trials in your experiment.}

\item{gamma}{[vector] Parameters used in the `util_func` (Utility Function), 
often referred to as the discount rate. For example, 
`utility = gamma * reward`, if gamma < 1, it indicates that people 
tend to discount the objective reward. Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `gamma = c(0.7)`}

\item{eta}{[vector] Parameters used in the `rate_func` (Learning Rate Function), 
representing the rate at which the subject updates the 
difference (prediction error) between the reward and the expected value 
in the subject's mind. In the TD model, there is a single learning rate 
throughout the experiment. In the RSTD model, two different learning rates 
are used when the reward is higher or lower than the expected value.
e.g., `eta = c(0.3, 0.7)`}

\item{epsilon}{[vector] Parameters used in the `expl_func` (Exploration Function), 
determining whether the subject makes decisions based on the relative values 
of the left and right options, or chooses completely randomly. For example, 
when epsilon = 0.1, it means the subject has a 10% chance of making a 
completely random choice and a 90% chance of choosing based on the values 
of the options.
e.g., `epsilon = c(0.1)`}

\item{tau}{[vector] Parameters used in the `prob_func` (Soft-Max Function), 
representing the sensitivity of the subject to the value difference when 
making decisions. It determines the probability of selecting the left option 
versus the right option based on their values. A larger value of tau 
indicates greater sensitivity to the value difference between the options. 
In other words, even a small difference in value will make the subject more 
likely to choose the higher-value option. 
e.g., `tau = c(0.5)`}

\item{lambda}{[vector] Extra parameters that may be used in functions. 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}
}
