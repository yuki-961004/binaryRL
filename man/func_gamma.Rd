\usage{
func_gamma(
  value,
  utility,
  reward,
  occurrence,
  var1 = NA,
  var2 = NA,
  gamma = 1,
  lambda
)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{The expected value of the stimulus in the subject's mind at this point in time.}

\item{utility}{The subjective value that the subject assigns to the objective reward.}

\item{reward}{The objective reward received by the subject after selecting a stimulus.}

\item{occurrence}{The number of times the same stimulus has appeared.}

\item{var1}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var1 = "Extra_Var1"`}

\item{var2}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var2 = "Extra_Var2"`}

\item{gamma}{A parameter used in the `util_func` (Utility Function), often 
referred to as the discount rate. For example, in the utility equation 
`utility = gamma * reward`, if gamma < 1, it indicates that people discount 
the objective reward. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `gamma = c(0.7)`}

\item{lambda}{An additional parameter that may be used in these functions. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}
}
\value{
Discount rate and utility
}

\note{
When customizing these functions, please ensure that you do not modify the arguments. 
Instead, only modify the `if-else` statements or the internal logic to adapt the function to your needs.
