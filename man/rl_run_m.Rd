\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the raw data. 
This data should include the following mandatory columns: 
- "sub", "time_line", "L_choice", "R_choice", "choose", "reward". 
The following arguments allow you to customize the column names used for processing}

\item{id}{A numeric value specifying the subject ID for which the model is being analyzed. 
The value should correspond to an entry in the "sub" column, which must contain the subject IDs. 
Provide the subject ID as a number.
e.g., `id = 18`}

\item{initial_value}{A numeric value representing the subject's initial expected value for each stimulus's reward. 
If this value is not set, the subject will use the reward received after the first trial as the initial value for that stimulus. 
In other words, the learning rate for the first trial is 100%. 
Provide the initial value as a number 
default: `initial_value = NA`
e.g., `initial_value = 0`}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the number of initial trials during which the subject makes random choices 
rather than choosing based on the values of the options. This occurs because the subject has not yet learned the values of the options. 
For example, threshold = 20 means the subject will make completely random choices for the first 20 trials.
Provide the value as a number. 
default: `threshold = 1`}

\item{n_params}{The number of free parameters in the model.}

\item{n_trials}{The total number of trials in the experiment.

## Parameters and Functions}

\item{gamma}{A parameter used in the `util_func` (Utility Function), often 
referred to as the discount rate. For example, in the utility equation 
`utility = gamma * reward`, if gamma < 1, it indicates that people discount 
the objective reward. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `gamma = c(0.7)`}

\item{eta}{A parameter used in the `rate_func` (Learning Rate Function), 
representing the rate at which the subject updates the difference between the reward and the expected value in the subject's mind. 
In the TD model, there is a single learning rate throughout the experiment. 
In the RSTD model, two different learning rates are used when the reward is higher or lower than the expected value.
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `eta = c(0.3, 0.7)`}

\item{epsilon}{A parameter used in the `expl_func` (Exploration Function), 
determining whether the subject makes decisions based on the relative values of the left and right options, 
or chooses completely randomly. 
For example, when epsilon = 0.1, it means the subject has a 10% chance of making a completely random choice 
and a 90% chance of choosing based on the values of the options.
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `epsilon = c(0.1)`}

\item{tau}{A parameter used in the `prob_func` (Soft-Max Function), representing the sensitivity of the subject to the value difference when making decisions. 
It determines the probability of selecting the left option versus the right option based on their values. A larger value of tau indicates greater sensitivity 
to the value difference between the options. In other words, even a small difference in value will make the subject more likely to choose the higher-value option. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `tau = c(0.5)`}

\item{lambda}{An additional parameter that may be used in these functions. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}

\item{util_func}{The function for the utility gamma, which you can customize}

\item{rate_func}{The function for the learning rate eta, which you can customize}

\item{expl_func}{The function for the epsilon greedy, which you can customize}

\item{prob_func}{The function for the temperature tau, which you can customize.

## Column Names}

\item{sub}{A string specifying the name of the column that contains the subject ID.
Provide the name of the column as a character string  
e.g., `sub = "Subject_ID"`}

\item{time_line}{A vector specifying the name of the column that the sequence of the experiment. 
This argument defines how the experiment is structured, such as whether it is organized by "Block" with breaks in between, and multiple trials within each block. 
Provide the sequence as a character vector, 
e.g., `time_line = c("Block", "Trial")`}

\item{L_choice}{A string specifying the name of the column that represents the left choice. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `L_choice = "Left_Choice"`}

\item{R_choice}{A string specifying the name of the column that represents the right choice. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `R_choice = "Right_Choice"`}

\item{choose}{A string specifying the name of the column that represents the choice made by the subject. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `choose = "Choose"`}

\item{reward}{A string specifying the name of the column that represents the reward associated with the subject's choice. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `reward = "Reward"`}

\item{var1}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var1 = "Extra_Var1"`}

\item{var2}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var2 = "Extra_Var2"`

## Other Arguments}

\item{softmax}{A logical value indicating whether to use the softmax function. 
When softmax = TRUE, the value of each option influences the probability of selecting that option. 
Higher values increase the probability of selecting that option. 
When softmax = FALSE, the subject will always choose the option with the higher value, with no possibility of selecting the lower-value option.
Provide the value as a logical (TRUE or FALSE).
default: `softmax = TRUE`}

\item{seed}{A numeric value to set the random seed. 
This ensures that the results are reproducible and remain the same each time the function is run.
Provide the value as a number. 
default: `seed = 123`}

\item{digits_1}{The number of decimal places to retain for values related to the value function. 
The default is 2.}

\item{digits_2}{The number of decimal places to retain for values related to the action function. 
The default is 5.}
