\usage{
func_tau(LR, try, L_value, R_value, var1 = NA, var2 = NA, tau = 1, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{LR}{Are you calculating the probability for the left option or the right option?}

\item{try}{If the choice was random, the value is 1; if the choice was based on value, the value is 0.}

\item{L_value}{The value of the left option}

\item{R_value}{The value of the right option}

\item{var1}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var1 = "Extra_Var1"`}

\item{var2}{A string specifying the name of an additional variable that can be used in the model. 
Provide the name of the column as a character string 
e.g., `var2 = "Extra_Var2"`}

\item{tau}{A parameter used in the `prob_func` (Soft-Max Function), representing the sensitivity of the subject to the value difference when making decisions. 
It determines the probability of selecting the left option versus the right option based on their values. A larger value of tau indicates greater sensitivity 
to the value difference between the options. In other words, even a small difference in value will make the subject more likely to choose the higher-value option. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `tau = c(0.5)`}

\item{lambda}{An additional parameter that may be used in these functions. 
Provide the value as a vector 
e.g., `lambda = c(0.4, 0.7, 20, 60)`}
}
\value{
The probability of choosing this option
}
